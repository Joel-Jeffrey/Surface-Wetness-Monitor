# Surface-Wetness-Monitor

This is a work aimed at monitoring the wetness of a surface and using that to ensure that the surface is sufficiently wet. Arduino obtains the analog readings from the wetness sensor and is programmed to calculate the percentage of wetness (based on the different readings obtained). Further, the arduino turns on the pump is the surface is not sufficiently wet and turns off if the specified wetness is attained. The code can be obtained from surfacewetnessmonitor.ino
